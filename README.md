# Private Events

This is a web application built with Ruby on Rails that allows users to create events and manage user signups. This application is similar to Eventbrite where users can create events, attend many events and an event can be attended by many users.

This project was inspired by the Odin Project's [Private Events](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events) project.
